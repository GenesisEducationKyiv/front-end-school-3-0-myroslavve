# Dependency Security Audit Report

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the project's dependencies and their security status. The audit was conducted to identify potential security vulnerabilities in third-party packages and ensure the project maintains a secure dependency tree.

The audit process includes:
- Analysis of npm package vulnerabilities
- Documentation of identified security issues
- Remediation steps taken
- Ongoing monitoring recommendations

## NPM Audit Results

### Initial Audit Findings

Date: 2025-06-14
Tool: `npm audit`

The initial security audit revealed **1 low severity vulnerability**:

**Vulnerability Details:**
- **Package:** brace-expansion
- **Affected Versions:** 1.0.0 - 1.1.11 || 2.0.0 - 2.0.1
- **Issue:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability
- **Severity:** Low
- **Advisory:** https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw

**Affected Locations:**
- `node_modules/@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree/node_modules/brace-expansion`
- `node_modules/brace-expansion`

### Remediation Actions

The vulnerability was successfully resolved by running the automated fix:

```bash
npm audit fix
```

**Post-Fix Audit Results:**
- **Vulnerabilities Found:** 0
- **Packages Audited:** 698
- **Status:** All security issues resolved

### Current Security Status

✅ **SECURE** - No known vulnerabilities detected in the current dependency tree.

## Additional Security Analysis

### Snyk Analysis

Date: 2025-06-14
Tool: `snyk test`

**Snyk Security Scan Results:**
- **Dependencies Tested:** 123
- **Vulnerable Paths Found:** 0
- **Organization:** myroslavve
- **Project Name:** client
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Target File:** package-lock.json
- **Open Source:** No

✅ **SECURE** - No vulnerable paths found in dependency tree.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider running `snyk monitor` for ongoing vulnerability notifications
- Integrate `snyk test` into CI/CD pipeline for continuous security testing
- Note: Multiple manifests detected (2) - consider using `--all-projects` flag for comprehensive scanning

**Zero Day Protection:** Snyk's database includes detection of newly discovered (zero day) vulnerabilities through continuous monitoring of security advisories and threat intelligence.

### Socket.dev Analysis

Date: 2025-06-14
Tool: Socket.dev

**Supply Chain Risk Assessment:**

| Alert Type | Category | Severity | Package | Version | Type | Issue |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|------|-------|
| Deprecated | Maintenance | Medium | glob | 7.2.3 | Transitive | Versions prior to v9 no longer supported |
| Deprecated | Maintenance | Medium | inflight | 1.0.6 | Transitive | Module not supported and leaks memory |
| Deprecated | Maintenance | Medium | abab | 2.0.6 | Transitive | Use native atob() and btoa() methods |
| Deprecated | Maintenance | Medium | domexception | 4.0.0 | Transitive | Use native DOMException instead |
| Telemetry | Supply Chain Risk | **High** | next | 15.3.1 | Direct | Data collection enabled by default |

**Key Findings:**
- **4 Deprecated Packages** (Medium severity) - All transitive dependencies
- **1 High-Risk Telemetry Issue** - Next.js data collection

**Zero Day Protection:** Socket.dev provides real-time analysis of package behavior and supply chain risks, including detection of suspicious activities that may indicate zero day exploits or newly compromised packages.

**Remediation Recommendations:**
1. **Next.js Telemetry** (High Priority):
   - Disable telemetry by setting environment variable: `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`
   - See: https://nextjs.org/telemetry for more information

2. **Deprecated Dependencies** (Medium Priority):
   - Monitor for updated versions of parent packages that use these deprecated dependencies
   - Consider updating to newer versions that use supported alternatives
   - Track deprecation timeline for planned migration

## Dependency Management Decisions

### Replacement of @mobily/ts-belt with Remeda

**Decision Date:** 2025-06-14

**Background:**
During the security analysis, `@mobily/ts-belt` was identified as having concerning characteristics that warranted replacement:

**Issues Identified:**
- **Low Socket.dev Score:** The package received a poor security rating from Socket.dev analysis
- **Maintenance Concerns:** Last release was over 2 years ago (indicating potential abandonment)
- **Security Risk:** Outdated packages pose higher security risks due to lack of ongoing maintenance and security patches

**Replacement Solution:**
- **New Package:** `remeda`
- **Rationale:** 
  - Active maintenance and regular updates
  - Better security posture and Socket.dev scoring
  - Similar functionality for functional programming utilities
  - Strong community support and documentation

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Audit current usage of `@mobily/ts-belt` in the codebase
2. Create migration guide for common function mappings
3. Update imports and refactor affected code
4. Test thoroughly to ensure functional equivalence
5. Update package.json dependencies
6. Remove `@mobily/ts-belt` from dependencies
